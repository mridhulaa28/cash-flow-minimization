# Cash Flow Minimizer

## Purpose
The **Cash Flow Minimizer** project aims to optimize the management of financial transactions between multiple banks. By minimizing redundant transactions, the system enhances financial efficiency.

## Overview/Features
- **Transaction Optimization**: Reduces the number of transactions needed to balance cash flow among banks.
- **Graph-Based Approach**: Uses a 2D array to represent and process transactions between banks.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Applies a greedy algorithm to determine the minimal set of transactions for balancing.
- **Dynamic Data Structures**: Utilizes `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `HashSet` for efficient data management and quick lookups.
- **Custom Classes**: Implements custom classes (`Bank` and `Pair`) to manage bank details and transactions.

## Results
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Successfully minimized redundant transactions, resulting in a more streamlined cash flow process.
- **Practical Implementation**: Can be utilized for real-world financial scenarios, which makes it easier for banks to manage and settle accounts.

## Conclusion
The Cash Flow Minimizer project effectively addresses the problem of excessive transactions by implementing a strategic optimization approach. The use of graphs, greedy algorithms, and custom data structures ensures a practical and efficient solution for balancing financial transactions among banks, leading to reduced costs and improved operational efficiency.
